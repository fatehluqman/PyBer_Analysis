# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Analysis is for ride sharing app company PyBer. The analysis was conducted on all the rideshare data from January to May of 2019. The object of the analysis is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
Using the Panda library from Python, created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, creating multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results: 

Summary of the results indicate that the number of rides in urban cities is greatest while rural cities have the lowest number of rides.  We can also see that urban cities also have the greater driver counts while Rual cities have the lowest driver count. 
It is not surprising then that the average fare is greater in rural cities while urban cities have the lowest average fares. Even though the data would indicate that there is greater demand in the urban citiesâ€™ dues to the greater number of rides, the reverse is true due to the larger number of available drivers in the urban cities. Increased number of drivers creates more competition driving down the cost of fares.
This is best summarized in the PyBer Ride Sharing Data(2019) scatter plot graph below.

The Ride Count Data(Fig2) graph shows the average number of rides by city type.  The average number fo rides in Urban cities is 24, compared to 17 in Suburban and just 6 in Rural.

The Ride Fare Data(Fig3) graph shows the average fare by city type.  The average fare in Urban cities is the lowest at 25, compared to 31 in Suburban and 37 in Rural.

The Driver Count Data(Fig4) graph shows the average driver count by city type.  Urban cities have the highest count of drivers at 37, compared to 16 in Suburban and 4 in Rural.

## Summary: 
1. The initial recommendation based on the higher fares in rural areas, with lower numbers of driver would be to implement a program to recruit more drivers for rural and suburban areas. 
2.Recommedation for a deeper analysis of driver data, to determine if the rural areas are underserved by the number of drivers.  This can be done by doing an analysis of drivers based on the population of each city types. For example, how many drivers are available compared to the population the rural, urban and suburban areas. 
3.Recommedation for a deeper analysis of rides data, to determine if there is demand for rides by city type.  This can be done by comparing the average number of rides by city type compared to the population of the city types. For example, how many rides per population in rural compared to suburban and urban. Additionally, other data would be useful, such as distance of each ride and time of each ride by city type. For example, how long in both distance and time are rural rides compared to other city types. This would give a better idea if there is a need for more drivers in these areas.
